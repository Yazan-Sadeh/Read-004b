Bill Gates says that computer is an electronic **machine** that **processes** information—in other words, an information processor.

Today, most computer users rely on prewritten programs like **Microsoft Word and Excel** or download apps for their tablets and smartphones without caring much how they got there. And his beauty of a computer is that it can run a word-processing program one minute, and then a photo-editing program five seconds later. In other words, although we don't really think of it this way, the computer can be **reprogrammed** as many times as you like.

That’s the basic idea behind an operating **system**:it's the core **software** in a computer that (essentially) controls the basic chores of input, output,**storage**, and processing. Also you can think of an operating system as the "foundations" of the software in a computer that other programs (called applications) are built on top of.
